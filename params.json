{"name":"Fingersmith","tagline":"Minimal webRTC signalling service for Kranky Geek 2015 - in scala - using fingerprints as IDs. Based on Socko","body":"### Welcome to Fingersmith.\r\nThis site is a public repo for experimentation, notes and demos associated with the use of WebRTC fingerprints as addresses.  \r\n\r\n### Here are a couple of videos to get you started: \r\n+ [Yopet.us ](https://yopet.us) - a minimal implementation for use with your feathered of furry friends\r\n+ [Kranky Geek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLXmB2TZyZE) - Some background on how and why.\r\n\r\n### TLDR;\r\nUsing WebRTC fingerprints as addresses in a federated communication system gives easy MiTM protection\r\nand secure P2P communication without the need to trust the federating systems. (You still need to \r\ntrust the javascript of course.) This technique is the subject of a pending patent.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@steely-glint (Tim Panton) and Westhawk Ltd ( https://www.westhawk.co.uk) \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
